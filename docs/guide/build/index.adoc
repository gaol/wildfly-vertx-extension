## Build the extension

This extension uses `Maven` as the build tool.

Requirements to build the extension are:

* JDK 11+
* Maven 3.2.5+

To build the extension, simply run the following command:

.Build command
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

When the command finishes, it will have produced two server distributions and a https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[Galleon] feature pack:

* Thin server
** Located at `build/target/wildfly-vertx-build-{project-version}/`.
** The thin server contains all configurations and JBoss module files (`module.xml`) which define the Maven artifact, without the jar files.
* Full server
** Located at `dist/target/wildfly-vertx-dist-{project-version}/`.
** The full server contains everything including jar files.
* Galleon feature pack
** Located at `galleon-feature-pack/wildfly-feature-pack/target/wildfly-vertx-feature-pack-{project-version}.zip`.
** This feature pack can be installed in an existing WildFly server.

Both produced servers have `2` standalone configurations:

* `standalone.xml`
** This is the setup with the Vert.x subsystem added to the default `standalone.xml` in WildFly server.
* `standalone-ha.xml`
** This is the setup with the Vert.x subsystem added to the default `standalone-ha.xml` in WildFly server.
** The default Vert.x in this setup is a clustered Vert.x with default configuration.

### Start the server

You can start the server like you do for normal WildFly server by specifying the desired configuration file:

.Start Server
[source,bash]
----
$SERVER_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml
----
