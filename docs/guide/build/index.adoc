## Build the extension

This extension uses `Maven` as the build tool.

Requirements to build the extension are:

* JDK 11+
* Maven 3.2.5+

To build the extension, simply run the following command:

.Build command
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

When the command finishes, it produces 2 server distributions and 1 https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[Galleon] feature pack:

* A Thin server
** It locates at `build/target/wildfly-vertx-build-{project-version}/`
** The thin server contains all configurations and JBoss module files(`module.xml` ) which define the Maven artifact without having the jar files.
* Full Server
** It locates at `dist/target/wildfly-vertx-build-{project-version}/`
** The full server contains everything including jar files
* A Galloen feature pack
** It locates at `galleon-feature-pack/target/wildfly-vertx-feature-pack-{project-version}.zip`
** This feature pack can be installed to an existing WildFly server.

Both produced servers have `4` standalone configurations:

* `standalone-vertx-mini.xml`
** This is the minimal setup to have vertx subsystem added and `jaxrs-server` layer added.
* `standalone-vertx.xml`
** This is the setup with vertx subsystem added compared to standard standalone.xml in WildFly server
* `standalone-vertx-ha.xml`
** This is the setup with vertx subsystem added compared to standard standalone-ha.xml in WildFly server
** The default vertx in this setup is a clustered vertx with default configuration.
* `standalone-vertx-full-ha.xml`
** This is the setup with vertx subsystem added compared to standard standalone-full-ha.xml in WildFly server
** The default vertx in this setup is a clustered vertx with default configuration.

### Start the server

You can start the servers using the same way how WildFly server gets started:

.Start Server
[source,bash]
----
$SERVER_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-vertx-mini.xml
----
