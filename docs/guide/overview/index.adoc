## Overview

This is the Vertx extension for https://www.wildfly.org/[WildFly Application Server].

https://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x] is a toolkit to build reactive applications on the JVM. Integrating it adds more reactive power to WildFly.

It allows you to define a Vert.x instance using WildFly's management model. The Vert.x instance is managed by the WildFly server. It can be accessed using JNDI lookup or CDI injection in your enterprise or web applications.

You can access the Vert.x core APIs and some component APIs in your applications.

You can package the Vert.x verticle implementation in the application, and deploy it to a WildFly server with a deployment descriptor. The server will do the deployment accordingly.

In case of clustering Vert.x instance, this extension uses https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-infinispan/[vertx-infinispan] as the cluster manager to be able to talk with remote Vert.x instances. You can specify the necessary JGroups settings for Vert.x, either using the standard WildFly management model, or specifying a JGroups stack file.

The generated distribution of this extension is a full WildFly server with above capabilities. The build produces only standalone configurations. Domain mode is not supported.

It also produces a Galleon feature pack, which can be installed to an existing WildFly server. You can install either the full feature pack, or layers of the feature pack.

The main goal of this extension is to explore a way for JakartaEE developers to benefit from some reactive utilities.
